    "## SOFT COSINE SIMILARITY FOR DOCUMENT MATCHING\n",
    "***A soft cosine or (\"soft\" similarity) between two vectors considers similarities between pairs of features. The traditional cosine similarity considers the vector space model (VSM) features as independent or completely different, while the soft cosine measure proposes considering the similarity of features in VSM, which help generalize the concept of cosine (and soft cosine) as well as the idea of (soft) similarity.*** \n",
